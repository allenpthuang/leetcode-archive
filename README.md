# LeetCode Archive
An archive for my Leetcode effort.

## Naming Convention
- The number at the beginning of every file is obviously the corresponding LeetCode #.
- The last underscore + number before the file extension (e.g. `_2.cpp`) indicates the version--I might try/releet several times...
- In the middle are the names of the LeetCode problems.

## Language
I majorly use C++ (C++11 or later).

## Note in the footers
Stats at submission is provided at the end of each file. But as you might already know, the numbers from LeetCode aren't the most accurate ones, so just some references.
